# Inference VS Prediction

## Learning Goals

- Describe the hallmarks of inferential statistics, and contrast them with the hallmarks of predictive statistics
- Relate the goals of model-building to expected value, bias and variance
- Define error as a function of prediction error and irreducible error
- Define prediction error as a combination of bias and variance
